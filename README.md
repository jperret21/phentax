`phentax` is a JAX re-implementation of the IMRPhenomT and IMRPhenomTHM gravitational waveform models as implemented in the [`phenomxpy` package](https://gitlab.com/imrphenom-dev/phenomxpy).

At present, `phentax` supports the generation of time-domain waveforms for quasi-circular, non-precessing binary black hole mergers, including higher-order modes (HMs) in the IMRPhenomTHM model. The implementation leverages JAX's capabilities for automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation, and batching to enable efficient waveform generation and parameter estimation.

## Note
This package is currently released as a beta version, and it could still show some undesired behaviors. If you encounter any issues, please report them on the [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/asantini29/phentax/issues). We welcome any contribution to the codebase: if you want to contribute, please open a pull request or contact the authors directly.

At present, publications using this code are discouraged until the package reaches a stable release. Please contact the authors if you want to discuss this further.

## Installation

### Installation from source
This project is managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). To set up the development environment, first clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/asantini29/phentax
cd phentax
```

**Important:** You must specify either CPU or GPU installation to ensure JAX is properly configured for your system.

### GPU Installation (CUDA)
For systems with NVIDIA GPUs and CUDA support, install with:
```
uv sync --group gpu
```
This installs all base dependencies plus JAX with CUDA 12.x support.

### CPU Installation
For CPU-only systems, install with:
```
uv sync --group cpu
```
This installs all base dependencies plus JAX optimized for CPU execution.

After installation, run your commands within this environment using:
```
uv run <YOUR-COMMAND>
```

### Installation from Package Index
`phentax` can also be installed directly with `pip`. Currently, the latest version is available on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/simple/). To install the latest version in your environment, run one of the following commands depending on your system configuration:
```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ 'phentax[cpu]' # For CPU-only installation
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ 'phentax[cuda12]' # For GPU installation with CUDA 12.x support
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ 'phentax[cuda13]' # For GPU installation with CUDA 13.x support
```
We still recommend installing the package in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.

## Credits
The original `python` implementation of the IMRPhenomT(HM) waveform models in the `phenomxpy` package were developed by Cecilio García Quirós. This JAX re-implementation builds upon his work. If you use this code in your research, please cite the original IMRPhenomT(HM) paper, and both the original `phenomxpy` package and this `phentax` implementation:
